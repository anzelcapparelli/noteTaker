  ## Description
  
  this app is a combination of front end and back end, in order to allow notes to be accessed between sessions, and on different devices. This app ustilizes the express module to handle routing on backend, and server requests are generated via jQuery
  
  ## Installation
  
  to download a personal version of the app, download files from the noteTaker repo on GitHub (provide link). from there, run ``` npm i ``` in the terminal to download the modules needed for this app
  
  ## Usage
  
  pressing 'Get Started' on the launch page navigates to a page that allows viewing, adding, and deleting notes. To view the contents of a note (if any exist), click on the title of the note on the right; to write a new note (from viewing previous notes), click on the button that looks like a pencil, enter a title and contents for the note, then press the save button that appears (when both fields have something entered); to delete a note, click on the trashbin button next to the desired note to delete). This app handles removing all notes (all can be deleted if desired).
  
  ## Testing
  
  no automated tests are currently included (will add in soon!). Current testing of saving notes with various contents, and deleting notes, can be performed manually on the deployed site.
